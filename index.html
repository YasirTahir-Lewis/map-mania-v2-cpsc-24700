            <h2>Welcome to Map Mania Version Two by Yasir! </h2>
            <p>The following game is a demonstration of the Google Maps JavaScript API. In order to play, the user must interact with the Google Maps interface (using pan and zoom) to search for a number of selected locations. Once the user is sufficiently
                zoomed in on the desired location and said location is within the bounds of the map, the following events will occur; An icon will drop on the location, the score will increase by one point, and the map will reset. From there, the user
                will continue to search for new locations until they've exhausted the options and achieved the maximum score of ten points; At this point, they've won the game. Users have two other tools at their disposal to help them too. These include
                a button labeled 'Free Win' and another labeled 'Click for Hint'. When the 'Free Win' button is clicked, the game will simulate a victory - assigning all ten points and dropping cursors on all the locations. When the 'Click for Hint' button
                is clicked, the user will be prompted with a block of text that helps to hint at where the desired location is. Good Luck and Enjoy the Game!
